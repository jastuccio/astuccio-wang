This entire blog is uncopyrighted (since December 2019). That means I’ve put it in the public domain, and released my copyright. I do my best to test out any programming/command line code I post. Following the advice in any of my posts is at your own risk.  Doing so will likely result in an exponential increase in happiness and joy! It is possible, but unlikely, that it could lead to things breaking or being embarrassed in front of your grandma at the next hackathon. 

There is no need to email me for permission — use my content however you want! Email it, share it, reprint it with or without credit, change it around, whatever. It’s OK. Attribution is appreciated, but not required. 

## Why I’m releasing copyright

This blog contains a lot of gathered information that helps me write code. Much of what I know about development has come through reading/watching/listening to:

* [Scott Tolinski](leveluptuts.com)
* [Wes Bos](wesbos.com)
* [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/)
* [Jonas Schmedtmann](codingheroes.io)
* [Lennart](https://www.lekoarts.de/en)
* [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/)
* [The Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
* [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* various blogs, YouTube channels, and podcasts

Thanks to Leo Babauta author of [Zen Habits](https://zenhabits.net/) for inspiring me to uncopyright!
